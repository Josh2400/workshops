Time permitting, you’ll be introduced to basic pre-processing with recipes. You’ll learn tidymodels syntax as well as the process of predictive modeling for tabular data.\nGetting More Out of Feature Engineering and Tuning for Machine Learning will teach you about model optimization using the tune and finetune packages, including racing and iterative methods.

PRN are numbers that emulate truly random numbers (but really are not truly random).\nThink of PRN as a box that takes a starting value (the “seed”) that produces random numbers using that starting value as an input into its process.\nIf we know a seed value, we can reproduce our “random” numbers. To use a different set of random numbers, choose a different seed value.\nFor example:\n\nset.seed(1)\nrunif(3)\n\n#&gt; [1] 0.2655087 0.3721239 0.5728534\n\n# Get a new set of random numbers:\nset.seed(2)\nrunif(3)\n\n#&gt; [1] 0.1848823 0.7023740 0.5733263\n\n# We can reproduce the old ones with the same seed\nset.seed(1)\nrunif(3)\n\n#&gt; [1] 0.2655087 0.3721239 0.5728534\n\n\nIf we don’t set the seed, R uses the clock time and the process ID to create a seed. This isn’t reproducible.\nSince we want our code to be reproducible, we set the seeds before random numbers are used.\nIn theory, you can set the seed once at the start of a script. However, if we do interactive data analysis, we might unwittingly use random numbers while coding. In that case, the stream is not the same and we don’t get reproducible results.\nThe value of the seed is an integer and really has no meaning. Max has a script to generate random integers to use as seeds to “spread the randomness around”. It is basically:\n\ncat(paste0(\"set.seed(\", sample.int(10000, 5), \")\", collapse = \"\\n\"))\n\n#&gt; set.seed(9725)\n#&gt; set.seed(8462)\n#&gt; set.seed(4050)\n#&gt; set.seed(8789)\n#&gt; set.seed(1301)"

Depending on the what was done with the data, consequences in doing that could be:\n\nYour performance metrics are slightly-to-moderately optimistic (e.g. you might think your accuracy is 85% when it is actually 75%)\nA consequential component of the analysis is not right and the model just doesn’t work.\n\nThe big issue here is that you won’t be able to figure this out until you get a new piece of data, such as the test set.\nA really good example of this is in ‘Selection bias in gene extraction on the basis of microarray gene-expression data’. The authors re-analyze a previous publication and show that the original researchers did not include feature selection in the workflow. Because of that, their performance statistics were extremely optimistic. In one case, they could do the original analysis on complete noise and still achieve zero errors.\nGenerally speaking, this problem is referred to as data leakage.

The matrix in question is called the “model matrix” and it contains the predictor set for the training data.\nMatrix inversion can fail if two or more columns:\n\nare identical, or\nadd up to some other column.\n\nThese situations are called linear dependencies.\nWhen this happens, lm() is pretty tolerant. It does not fail but does not compute regression coefficients for a minimal number of predictors involved in the dependency (and issues the warning above).\nFor these data, there is this dependency:\nshooter_type_{level} = shooter_{level}\nHere is what is happening: since the player shooting only ever plays a single position, their indicators sum up (row-wide) to the same data as the sum of the shooter type indicators.\nIn other words, if you know the player’s name, you know their position too. This is a perfect redundency in the data.\nThe way to avoid this problem is to use step_lincomb(all_numeric_predictors()) in the recipe. This step removes the minimum number of columns to avoid the issue.\nJust in case you ever want to figure out what the specific issues are, this code might help:\n\n# Get the exact data set used to fit the model. For a recipe, that is:\nprocessed_data &lt;- \n  nhl_indicators %&gt;% \n  prep() %&gt;% \n  bake(new_data = NULL, all_predictors())\n\n# Let's capture their names:\npred_names &lt;- names(processed_data)\n\n# caret has a function to determine the variables involved in each dependency\nissues &lt;- caret::findLinearCombos(processed_data)\n# Convert the column index to names:\nissues_vars &lt;- purrr::map(issues$linearCombos, ~ pred_names[.x])\n\n# caret proposes removing these columns to get rid of the issue. The choice\n# is pretty arbitrary: \nremoved_names &lt;- pred_names[issues$remove]\n\ntl;dr\nLinear regression detects some redundancies in the predictor set.

    "text": "Per-player statistics\nThe effect encoding method essentially takes the effect of a variable, like player, and makes a data column for that effect. In our example, the ability of a player to have an on-goal shot is quantified by a model and then added as a data column to be used in the model.\nSuppose NHL rookie Max has a single shot in the data and it was on goal. If we used a naive estimate for Max’s effect, the model is being told that Max should have a 100% chance of being on goal. That’s a very poor estimate since it is from a single data point.\nContrast this with seasoned player Davis, who has taken 250 shots and 75% of these were on goal. Davis’s proportion is more predictive because it is estimated with better data (i.e., more total shots). Partial pooling leverages the entire data set and can borrow strength from all of the players. It is a common tool in Bayesian estimation and non-Bayesian mixed models. If a player’s data is of good quality, the partial pooling effect estimate is closer to the raw proportion. Max’s data is not great and is “shrunk” towards the center of the overall on goal proportion. Since there is so little known about Max’s shot history, this is a better effect estimate (until more data is available for him).\nThe Stan documentation has a pretty good vignette on this: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rstanarm/vignettes/pooling.html\nAlso, Bayes Rules! has a nice section on this: https://www.bayesrulesbook.com/chapter-15.html\nIf the outcome were numeric, the effect would be the mean of the outcome per player. In this case, partial pooling is very similar to the James–Stein estimator: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James–Stein_estimator"

For this reason, it is super important to make sure that we verify that we aren’t overfitting by checking with resampling (or a validation set).\nPartial pooling somewhat lowers the risk of overfitting since it tends to correct for players with small sample sizes. It can’t correct for improper data usage or data leakage though."

    "text": "Debugging a recipe\n\nTypically, you will want to use a workflow to estimate and apply a recipe.\n\n\n\nIf you have an error and need to debug your recipe, the original recipe object (e.g. encoded_players) can be estimated manually with a function called prep(). It is analogous to fit(). See TMwR section 16.4\n\n\n\n\nAnother function (bake()) is analogous to predict(), and gives you the processed data back.\n\n\n\n\nThe tidy() function can be used to get specific results from the recipe."

    "text": "Data splitting and spending\nWhat does set.seed() do?\nWe’ll use pseudo-random numbers (PRN) to partition the data into training and testing. PRN are numbers that emulate truly random numbers (but really are not truly random).\nThink of PRN as a box that takes a starting value (the “seed”) that produces random numbers using that starting value as an input into its process.\nIf we know a seed value, we can reproduce our “random” numbers. To use a different set of random numbers, choose a different seed value.\nFor example:\n\nset.seed(1)\nrunif(3)\n\n#&gt; [1] 0.2655087 0.3721239 0.5728534\n\n# Get a new set of random numbers:\nset.seed(2)\nrunif(3)\n\n#&gt; [1] 0.1848823 0.7023740 0.5733263\n\n# We can reproduce the old ones with the same seed\nset.seed(1)\nrunif(3)\n\n#&gt; [1] 0.2655087 0.3721239 0.5728534\n\n\nIf we don’t set the seed, R uses the clock time and the process ID to create a seed. This isn’t reproducible.\nSince we want our code to be reproducible, we set the seeds before random numbers are used.\nIn theory, you can set the seed once at the start of a script. However, if we do interactive data analysis, we might unwittingly use random numbers while coding. In that case, the stream is not the same and we don’t get reproducible results.\nThe value of the seed is an integer and really has no meaning. Max has a script to generate random integers to use as seeds to “spread the randomness around”. It is basically:\n\ncat(paste0(\"set.seed(\", sample.int(10000, 5), \")\", collapse = \"\\n\"))\n\n#&gt; set.seed(9725)\n#&gt; set.seed(8462)\n#&gt; set.seed(4050)\n#&gt; set.seed(8789)\n#&gt; set.seed(1301)"

Depending on the what was done with the data, consequences in doing that could be:\n\nYour performance metrics are slightly-to-moderately optimistic (e.g. you might think your accuracy is 85% when it is actually 75%)\nA consequential component of the analysis is not right and the model just doesn’t work.\n\nThe big issue here is that you won’t be able to figure this out until you get a new piece of data, such as the test set.\nA really good example of this is in ‘Selection bias in gene extraction on the basis of microarray gene-expression data’. The authors re-analyze a previous publication and show that the original researchers did not include feature selection in the workflow. Because of that, their performance statistics were extremely optimistic. In one case, they could do the original analysis on complete noise and still achieve zero errors.\nGenerally speaking, this problem is referred to as data leakage.

    "text": "Per-player statistics\nThe effect encoding method essentially takes the effect of a variable, like player, and makes a data column for that effect. In our example, the ability of a player to have an on-goal shot is quantified by a model and then added as a data column to be used in the model.\nSuppose NHL rookie Max has a single shot in the data and it was on goal. If we used a naive estimate for Max’s effect, the model is being told that Max should have a 100% chance of being on goal. That’s a very poor estimate since it is from a single data point.\nContrast this with seasoned player Davis, who has taken 250 shots and 75% of these were on goal. Davis’s proportion is more predictive because it is estimated with better data (i.e., more total shots). Partial pooling leverages the entire data set and can borrow strength from all of the players. It is a common tool in Bayesian estimation and non-Bayesian mixed models. If a player’s data is of good quality, the partial pooling effect estimate is closer to the raw proportion. Max’s data is not great and is “shrunk” towards the center of the overall on goal proportion. Since there is so little known about Max’s shot history, this is a better effect estimate (until more data is available for him).\nThe Stan documentation has a pretty good vignette on this: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rstanarm/vignettes/pooling.html\nAlso, Bayes Rules! has a nice section on this: https://www.bayesrulesbook.com/chapter-15.html\nIf the outcome were numeric, the effect would be the mean of the outcome per player. In this case, partial pooling is very similar to the James–Stein estimator: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James–Stein_estimator"

The risk here is that we might over-fit the effect to the data. For this reason, it is super important to make sure that we verify that we aren’t overfitting by checking with resampling (or a validation set).\nPartial pooling somewhat lowers the risk of overfitting since it tends to correct for players with small sample sizes. It can’t correct for improper data usage or data leakage though."

It does not fail but does not compute regression coefficients for a minimal number of predictors involved in the dependency (and issues the warning above).\nFor these data, there are three dependencies between:\n\ndefense_team_PIT and offense_team_PIT\nstrength_short_handed, player_diff, and strength_power_play\nyear, month_Oct, month_Nov, and month_Dec\n\nThe first one is easy to explain.

The dependency is\n(Intercept) = defense_team_PIT + offense_team_PIT\nThe way to avoid this problem is to use step_lincomb(all_numeric_predictors()) in the recipe.

    "text": "What is set.seed()?\nWhat does set.seed() do?\nWe’ll use pseudo-random numbers (PRN) to partition the data into training and testing. PRN are numbers that emulate truly random numbers (but really are not truly random).\nThink of PRN as a box that takes a starting value (the “seed”) that produces random numbers using that starting value as an input into its process.\nIf we know a seed value, we can reproduce our “random” numbers. To use a different set of random numbers, choose a different seed value.\nFor example:\n\nset.seed(1)\nrunif(3)\n#&gt; [1] 0.2655087 0.3721239 0.5728534\n\n# Get a new set of random numbers:\nset.seed(2)\nrunif(3)\n#&gt; [1] 0.1848823 0.7023740 0.5733263\n\n# We can reproduce the old ones with the same seed\nset.seed(1)\nrunif(3)\n#&gt; [1] 0.2655087 0.3721239 0.5728534\n\nIf we don’t set the seed, R uses the clock time and the process ID to create a seed. This isn’t reproducible.\nSince we want our code to be reproducible, we set the seeds before random numbers are used.\nIn theory, you can set the seed once at the start of a script. However, if we do interactive data analysis, we might unwittingly use random numbers while coding. In that case, the stream is not the same, and we don’t get reproducible results.\nThe value of the seed is an integer and really has no meaning. Max has a script to generate random integers to use as seeds to “spread the randomness around”. It is basically:\n\ncat(paste0(\"set.seed(\", sample.int(10000, 5), \")\", collapse = \"\\n\"))\n#&gt; set.seed(9725)\n#&gt; set.seed(8462)\n#&gt; set.seed(4050)\n#&gt; set.seed(8789)\n#&gt; set.seed(1301)"

Depending on what was done with the data, the consequences of doing that could be:\n\nYour performance metrics are slightly-to-moderately optimistic (e.g., you might think your accuracy is 85% when it is actually 75%)\nA consequential component of the analysis is not right, and the model just doesn’t work.\n\nThe big issue here is that you won’t be able to figure this out until you get a new piece of data, such as the test set.\nA really good example of this is in ‘Selection bias in gene extraction on the basis of microarray gene-expression data’. The authors re-analyze a previous publication and show that the original researchers did not include feature selection in the workflow. Because of that, their performance statistics were extremely optimistic. In one case, they could do the original analysis on complete noise and still achieve zero errors.\nGenerally speaking, this problem is referred to as data leakage.

In this case, the Brier score is zero.\nWhen the model is uninformative and there are two classes, the worst-case values range from 0.25 to about 0.50. Imagine that the model predicts the same noninformative prediction of 50% (basically “¯\\(ツ)/¯”). In that case, every prediction is either \\((0.00 - 0.50)^2\\) or \\((1.00 - 0.50)^2\\). The average of those is 0.25.\nThere are many different ways a model can be bad, though, and some of these will produce Brier scores between 0.25 and 0.50."

For example, if you were to update the mtry parameter in a random forest model, the code would look like\n\nparameter_object |&gt; \n  update(mtry = mtry(c(1, 100)))\n\nIn some cases, the parameter function or its associated values differ from the argument name.\nFor example, with step_spline_naturall(), we might want to tune the deg_free argument (for the degrees of freedom of a spline function). In this case, the argument name is deg_free, but we update it with spline_degree().\ndeg_free represents the general concept of degrees of freedom and could be associated with many different things. For example, if we ever had an argument that was the number of degrees of freedom for a \\(t\\) distribution, we would call that argument deg_free.\nWe probably want a wider range of degrees of freedom for splines. To this end, we created a specialized function called spline_degree().\nHow can you tell when this happens? There is a helper function called tunable(), and that gives information on how we make the default ranges for parameters.

    "text": "Per-agent statistics\nThe effect encoding method essentially takes the effect of a variable, like an agent, and creates a data column for that effect. In our example, the agent’s effect on the ADR is quantified by a model and then added as a data column to be used in the model.\nSuppose agent Max has a single reservation in the data, with an ADR of €200. If we use a naive estimate for Max’s effect, the model is told that Max should always produce an effect of €200. That’s a very poor estimate since it is from a single data point.\nContrast this with seasoned agent Davis, who has taken 250 reservations with an average ADR of €100. Davis’s mean is more predictive because it is estimated with better data (i.e., more total reservations). Partial pooling leverages the entire data set and can borrow strength from all of the agents. It is a common tool in Bayesian estimation and non-Bayesian mixed models. If an agent’s data is of good quality, the partial pooling effect estimate is closer to the raw mean. Max’s data is not great and is “shrunk” towards the center of the overall average. Since there is so little known about Max’s reservation history, this is a better effect estimate (until more data is available for him).\nThe Stan documentation has a pretty good vignette on this: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rstanarm/vignettes/pooling.html\nAlso, Bayes Rules! has a nice section on this: https://www.bayesrulesbook.com/chapter-15.html\nSince this example has a numeric outcome, partial pooling is very similar to the James–Stein estimator: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James–Stein_estimator"

The risk here is that we might overfit the effect to the data. For this reason, it is super important to verify that we aren’t overfitting by checking with resampling (or a validation set).\nPartial pooling somewhat lowers the risk of overfitting since it tends to correct for agents with small sample sizes. However, it can’t correct for improper data usage or data leakage."

PRN are numbers that emulate truly random numbers (but really are not truly random).\nThink of PRN as a box that takes a starting value (the “seed”) that produces random numbers using that starting value as an input into its process.\nIf we know a seed value, we can reproduce our “random” numbers. To use a different set of random numbers, choose a different seed value.\nFor example:\n\nset.seed(1)\nrunif(3)\n#&gt; [1] 0.2655087 0.3721239 0.5728534\n\n# Get a new set of random numbers:\nset.seed(2)\nrunif(3)\n#&gt; [1] 0.1848823 0.7023740 0.5733263\n\n# We can reproduce the old ones with the same seed\nset.seed(1)\nrunif(3)\n#&gt; [1] 0.2655087 0.3721239 0.5728534\n\nIf we don’t set the seed, R uses the clock time and the process ID to create a seed. This isn’t reproducible.\nSince we want our code to be reproducible, we set the seeds before random numbers are used.\nIn theory, you can set the seed once at the start of a script. However, if we do interactive data analysis, we might unwittingly use random numbers while coding. In that case, the stream is not the same and we don’t get reproducible results.\nThe value of the seed is an integer and really has no meaning. Max has a script to generate random integers to use as seeds to “spread the randomness around”. It is basically:\n\ncat(paste0(\"set.seed(\", sample.int(10000, 5), \")\", collapse = \"\\n\"))\n#&gt; set.seed(9725)\n#&gt; set.seed(8462)\n#&gt; set.seed(4050)\n#&gt; set.seed(8789)\n#&gt; set.seed(1301)"

Depending on the what was done with the data, consequences in doing that could be:\n\nYour performance metrics are slightly-to-moderately optimistic (e.g. you might think your accuracy is 85% when it is actually 75%)\nA consequential component of the analysis is not right and the model just doesn’t work.\n\nThe big issue here is that you won’t be able to figure this out until you get a new piece of data, such as the test set.\nA really good example of this is in ‘Selection bias in gene extraction on the basis of microarray gene-expression data’. The authors re-analyze a previous publication and show that the original researchers did not include feature selection in the workflow. Because of that, their performance statistics were extremely optimistic. In one case, they could do the original analysis on complete noise and still achieve zero errors.\nGenerally speaking, this problem is referred to as data leakage.

In this case, the Brier score is zero.\nWhen the model is uninformative and there are two classes, the worst-case values range from 0.25 to about 0.50. Imagine that the model predicts the same noninformative prediction of 50% (basically “¯\\(ツ)/¯”). In that case, every prediction is either \\((0.00 - 0.50)^2\\) or \\((1.00 - 0.50)^2\\).

    "text": "Per-agent statistics\nThe effect encoding method essentially takes the effect of a variable, like agent, and makes a data column for that effect. In our example, affect of the agent on the ADR is quantified by a model and then added as a data column to be used in the model.\nSuppose agent Max has a single reservation in the data and it had an ADR of €200. If we used a naive estimate for Max’s effect, the model is being told that Max should always produce an effect of €200. That’s a very poor estimate since it is from a single data point.\nContrast this with seasoned agent Davis, who has taken 250 reservations with an average ADR of €100. Davis’s mean is more predictive because it is estimated with better data (i.e., more total reservations). Partial pooling leverages the entire data set and can borrow strength from all of the agents. It is a common tool in Bayesian estimation and non-Bayesian mixed models. If a agent’s data is of good quality, the partial pooling effect estimate is closer to the raw mean. Max’s data is not great and is “shrunk” towards the center of the overall average. Since there is so little known about Max’s reservation history, this is a better effect estimate (until more data is available for him).\nThe Stan documentation has a pretty good vignette on this: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rstanarm/vignettes/pooling.html\nAlso, Bayes Rules! has a nice section on this: https://www.bayesrulesbook.com/chapter-15.html\nSince this example has a numeric outcome, partial pooling is very similar to the James–Stein estimator: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James–Stein_estimator"

A common one is:\n\n\\[\\operatorname{cov}(\\boldsymbol{x}_i, \\boldsymbol{x}_j) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}|\\boldsymbol{x}_i - \\boldsymbol{x}_j|^2\\right) + \\sigma^2_{ij}\\]\n\nGPs are good because\n\nthey are flexible regression models (in the sense that splines are flexible).\nwe need to get mean and variance predictions (and they are Bayesian)\ntheir variability is based on spatial distances.\n\nSome people use random forests (with conformal variance estimates) or other methods but GPs are most popular."

A common one is:\n\n\\[\\operatorname{cov}(\\boldsymbol{x}_i, \\boldsymbol{x}_j) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}|\\boldsymbol{x}_i - \\boldsymbol{x}_j|^2\\right) + \\sigma^2_{ij}\\]\n\nGPs are good because\n\nthey are flexible regression models (in the sense that splines are flexible).\nwe need to get mean and variance predictions (and they are Bayesian)\ntheir variability is based on spatial distances.\n\nSome people use random forests (with conformal variance estimates) or other methods but GPs are most popular."

The more elaborate the estimation in your preprocessing, the higher the risk of overfitting coming back to bite you. An example of a more elaborate preprocessing estimation is principal components."

    "text": "The initial split\nWhat does set.seed() do?\nWe’ll use pseudo-random numbers (PRN) to partition the data into training and testing. PRN are numbers that emulate truly random numbers (but really are not truly random).\nThink of PRN as a box that takes a starting value (the “seed”) that produces random numbers using that starting value as an input into its process.\nIf we know a seed value, we can reproduce our “random” numbers. To use a different set of random numbers, choose a different seed value.\nFor example:\n\nset.seed(1)\nrunif(3)\n#&gt; [1] 0.2655087 0.3721239 0.5728534\n\n# Get a new set of random numbers:\nset.seed(2)\nrunif(3)\n#&gt; [1] 0.1848823 0.7023740 0.5733263\n\n# We can reproduce the old ones with the same seed\nset.seed(1)\nrunif(3)\n#&gt; [1] 0.2655087 0.3721239 0.5728534\n\nIf we don’t set the seed, R uses the clock time and the process ID to create a seed. This isn’t reproducible.\nSince we want our code to be reproducible, we set the seeds before random numbers are used.\nIn theory, you can set the seed once at the start of a script. However, if we do interactive data analysis, we might unwittingly use random numbers while coding. In that case, the stream is not the same and we don’t get reproducible results.\nThe value of the seed is an integer and really has no meaning. Max has a script to generate random integers to use as seeds to “spread the randomness around”. It is basically:\n\ncat(paste0(\"set.seed(\", sample.int(10000, 5), \")\", collapse = \"\\n\"))\n#&gt; set.seed(9725)\n#&gt; set.seed(8462)\n#&gt; set.seed(4050)\n#&gt; set.seed(8789)\n#&gt; set.seed(1301)"

Depending on the what was done with the data, consequences in doing that could be:\n\nYour performance metrics are slightly-to-moderately optimistic (e.g. you might think your accuracy is 85% when it is actually 75%)\nA consequential component of the analysis is not right and the model just doesn’t work.\n\nThe big issue here is that you won’t be able to figure this out until you get a new piece of data, such as the test set.\nA really good example of this is in ‘Selection bias in gene extraction on the basis of microarray gene-expression data’. The authors re-analyze a previous publication and show that the original researchers did not include feature selection in the workflow. Because of that, their performance statistics were extremely optimistic. In one case, they could do the original analysis on complete noise and still achieve zero errors.\nGenerally speaking, this problem is referred to as data leakage.

For example, if you were to update the mtry parameter in a random forests model, the code would look like\n\nparameter_object %&gt;% \n  update(mtry = mtry(c(1, 100)))\n\nThere are some cases where the parameter function, or its associated values, are different from the argument name.\nFor example, with step_spline_naturall(), we might want to tune the deg_free argument (for the degrees of freedom of a spline function. ). In this case, the argument name is deg_free but we update it with spline_degree().\ndeg_free represents the general concept of degrees of freedom and could be associated with many different things. For example, if we ever had an argument that was the number of degrees of freedom for a \\(t\\) distribution, we would call that argument deg_free.\nFor splines, we probably want a wider range for the degrees of freedom. We made a specialized function called spline_degree() to be used in these cases.\nHow can you tell when this happens? There is a helper function called tunable() and that gives information on how we make the default ranges for parameters.

If the model doesn’t make any improvements for stop_iter iterations, training stops.\nHere’s an example where, after eleven iterations, performance starts to get worse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is likely due to over-fitting so we stop the model at eleven boosting iterations.\nEarly stopping usually has good results and takes far less time.\nWe could an engine argument called validation here. That’s not an argument to any function in the lightgbm package.\nbonsai has its own wrapper around (lightgbm::lgb.train()) called bonsai::train_lightgbm(). We use that here and it has a validation argument.\nHow would you know that? There are a few different ways:\n\nLook at the documentation in ?boost_tree and click on the lightgbm entry in the engine list.\nCheck out the pkgdown reference website https://parsnip.tidymodels.org/reference/index.html\nRun the translate() function on the parsnip specification object.\n\nThe first two options are best since they tell you a lot more about the particularities of each model engine (there are a lot for lightgbm)."

    "text": "Per-agent statistics\nThe effect encoding method essentially takes the effect of a variable, like agent, and makes a data column for that effect. In our example, affect of the agent on the ADR is quantified by a model and then added as a data column to be used in the model.\nSuppose agent Max has a single reservation in the data and it had an ADR of €200. If we used a naive estimate for Max’s effect, the model is being told that Max should always produce an effect of €200. That’s a very poor estimate since it is from a single data point.\nContrast this with seasoned agent Davis, who has taken 250 reservations with an average ADR of €100. Davis’s mean is more predictive because it is estimated with better data (i.e., more total reservations). Partial pooling leverages the entire data set and can borrow strength from all of the agents. It is a common tool in Bayesian estimation and non-Bayesian mixed models. If a agent’s data is of good quality, the partial pooling effect estimate is closer to the raw mean. Max’s data is not great and is “shrunk” towards the center of the overall average. Since there is so little known about Max’s reservation history, this is a better effect estimate (until more data is available for him).\nThe Stan documentation has a pretty good vignette on this: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rstanarm/vignettes/pooling.html\nAlso, Bayes Rules! has a nice section on this: https://www.bayesrulesbook.com/chapter-15.html\nSince this example has a numeric outcome, partial pooling is very similar to the James–Stein estimator: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James–Stein_estimator"

The risk here is that we might over-fit the effect to the data. For this reason, it is super important to make sure that we verify that we aren’t overfitting by checking with resampling (or a validation set).\nPartial pooling somewhat lowers the risk of overfitting since it tends to correct for agents with small sample sizes. It can’t correct for improper data usage or data leakage though."

    "text": "The initial split\nWhat does set.seed() do?\nWe’ll use pseudo-random numbers (PRN) to partition the data into training and testing. PRN are numbers that emulate truly random numbers (but really are not truly random).\nThink of PRN as a box that takes a starting value (the “seed”) that produces random numbers using that starting value as an input into its process.\nIf we know a seed value, we can reproduce our “random” numbers. To use a different set of random numbers, choose a different seed value.\nFor example:\n\nset.seed(1)\nrunif(3)\n#&gt; [1] 0.2655087 0.3721239 0.5728534\n\n# Get a new set of random numbers:\nset.seed(2)\nrunif(3)\n#&gt; [1] 0.1848823 0.7023740 0.5733263\n\n# We can reproduce the old ones with the same seed\nset.seed(1)\nrunif(3)\n#&gt; [1] 0.2655087 0.3721239 0.5728534\n\nIf we don’t set the seed, R uses the clock time and the process ID to create a seed. This isn’t reproducible.\nSince we want our code to be reproducible, we set the seeds before random numbers are used.\nIn theory, you can set the seed once at the start of a script. However, if we do interactive data analysis, we might unwittingly use random numbers while coding. In that case, the stream is not the same and we don’t get reproducible results.\nThe value of the seed is an integer and really has no meaning. Max has a script to generate random integers to use as seeds to “spread the randomness around”. It is basically:\n\ncat(paste0(\"set.seed(\", sample.int(10000, 5), \")\", collapse = \"\\n\"))\n#&gt; set.seed(9725)\n#&gt; set.seed(8462)\n#&gt; set.seed(4050)\n#&gt; set.seed(8789)\n#&gt; set.seed(1301)"

Depending on the what was done with the data, consequences in doing that could be:\n\nYour performance metrics are slightly-to-moderately optimistic (e.g. you might think your accuracy is 85% when it is actually 75%)\nA consequential component of the analysis is not right and the model just doesn’t work.\n\nThe big issue here is that you won’t be able to figure this out until you get a new piece of data, such as the test set.\nA really good example of this is in ‘Selection bias in gene extraction on the basis of microarray gene-expression data’. The authors re-analyze a previous publication and show that the original researchers did not include feature selection in the workflow. Because of that, their performance statistics were extremely optimistic. In one case, they could do the original analysis on complete noise and still achieve zero errors.\nGenerally speaking, this problem is referred to as data leakage.

For example, if you were to update the mtry parameter in a random forests model, the code would look like\n\nparameter_object %&gt;% \n  update(mtry = mtry(c(1, 100)))\n\nThere are some cases where the parameter function, or its associated values, are different from the argument name.\nFor example, with step_spline_naturall(), we might want to tune the deg_free argument (for the degrees of freedom of a spline function. ). In this case, the argument name is deg_free but we update it with spline_degree().\ndeg_free represents the general concept of degrees of freedom and could be associated with many different things. For example, if we ever had an argument that was the number of degrees of freedom for a \\(t\\) distribution, we would call that argument deg_free.\nFor splines, we probably want a wider range for the degrees of freedom. We made a specialized function called spline_degree() to be used in these cases.\nHow can you tell when this happens? There is a helper function called tunable() and that gives information on how we make the default ranges for parameters.

If the model doesn’t make any improvements for stop_iter iterations, training stops.\nHere’s an example where, after eleven iterations, performance starts to get worse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is likely due to over-fitting so we stop the model at eleven boosting iterations.\nEarly stopping usually has good results and takes far less time.\nWe could an engine argument called validation here. That’s not an argument to any function in the lightgbm package.\nbonsai has its own wrapper around (lightgbm::lgb.train()) called bonsai::train_lightgbm(). We use that here and it has a validation argument.\nHow would you know that? There are a few different ways:\n\nLook at the documentation in ?boost_tree and click on the lightgbm entry in the engine list.\nCheck out the pkgdown reference website https://parsnip.tidymodels.org/reference/index.html\nRun the translate() function on the parsnip specification object.\n\nThe first two options are best since they tell you a lot more about the particularities of each model engine (there are a lot for lightgbm)."

    "text": "Per-agent statistics\nThe effect encoding method essentially takes the effect of a variable, like agent, and makes a data column for that effect. In our example, affect of the agent on the ADR is quantified by a model and then added as a data column to be used in the model.\nSuppose agent Max has a single reservation in the data and it had an ADR of €200. If we used a naive estimate for Max’s effect, the model is being told that Max should always produce an effect of €200. That’s a very poor estimate since it is from a single data point.\nContrast this with seasoned agent Davis, who has taken 250 reservations with an average ADR of €100. Davis’s mean is more predictive because it is estimated with better data (i.e., more total reservations). Partial pooling leverages the entire data set and can borrow strength from all of the agents. It is a common tool in Bayesian estimation and non-Bayesian mixed models. If a agent’s data is of good quality, the partial pooling effect estimate is closer to the raw mean. Max’s data is not great and is “shrunk” towards the center of the overall average. Since there is so little known about Max’s reservation history, this is a better effect estimate (until more data is available for him).\nThe Stan documentation has a pretty good vignette on this: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rstanarm/vignettes/pooling.html\nAlso, Bayes Rules! has a nice section on this: https://www.bayesrulesbook.com/chapter-15.html\nSince this example has a numeric outcome, partial pooling is very similar to the James–Stein estimator: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James–Stein_estimator"

The risk here is that we might over-fit the effect to the data. For this reason, it is super important to make sure that we verify that we aren’t overfitting by checking with resampling (or a validation set).\nPartial pooling somewhat lowers the risk of overfitting since it tends to correct for agents with small sample sizes. It can’t correct for improper data usage or data leakage though."

The tidymodels framework is a collection of packages for modeling and machine learning using tidyverse principles. This website hosts the materials for both the Introduction to tidymodels and Advanced tidymodels courses.\nIntroduction to tidymodels will teach you core tidymodels packages and their uses: data splitting/resampling with rsample, model fitting with parsnip, measuring model performance with yardstick, and basic pre-processing with recipes. Time permitting, you’ll be introduced to model optimization using the tune package. You’ll learn tidymodels syntax as well as the process of predictive modeling for tabular data.\nAdvanced tidymodels will teach you about model optimization using the tune and finetune packages, including racing and iterative methods. You’ll be able to do more sophisticated feature engineering with recipes. Time permitting, model ensembles via stacking will be introduced. This course is focused on the analysis of tabular data and does not include deep learning methods."

To use a different set of random numbers, choose a different seed value.\nFor example:\n\nset.seed(1)\nrunif(3)\n#&gt; [1] 0.2655087 0.3721239 0.5728534\n\n# Get a new set of random numbers:\nset.seed(2)\nrunif(3)\n#&gt; [1] 0.1848823 0.7023740 0.5733263\n\n# We can reproduce the old ones with the same seed\nset.seed(1)\nrunif(3)\n#&gt; [1] 0.2655087 0.3721239 0.5728534\n\nIf we don’t set the seed, R uses the clock time and the process ID to create a seed. This isn’t reproducible.\nSince we want our code to be reproducible, we set the seeds before random numbers are used.\nIn theory, you can set the seed once at the start of a script. However, if we do interactive data analysis, we might unwittingly use random numbers while coding. In that case, the stream is not the same and we don’t get reproducible results.\nThe value of the seed is an integer and really has no meaning. Max has a script to generate random integers to use as seeds to “spread the randomness around”. It is basically:\n\ncat(paste0(\"set.seed(\", sample.int(10000, 5), \")\", collapse = \"\\n\"))\n#&gt; set.seed(9725)\n#&gt; set.seed(8462)\n#&gt; set.seed(4050)\n#&gt; set.seed(8789)\n#&gt; set.seed(1301)"

Depending on the what was done with the data, consequences in doing that could be:\n\nYour performance metrics are slightly-to-moderately optimistic (e.g. you might think your accuracy is 85% when it is actually 75%)\nA consequential component of the analysis is not right and the model just doesn’t work.\n\nThe big issue here is that you won’t be able to figure this out until you get a new piece of data, such as the test set.\nA really good example of this is in ‘Selection bias in gene extraction on the basis of microarray gene-expression data’. The authors re-analyze a previous publication and show that the original researchers did not include feature selection in the workflow. Because of that, their performance statistics were extremely optimistic. In one case, they could do the original analysis on complete noise and still achieve zero errors.\nGenerally speaking, this problem is referred to as data leakage.

In this case, the Brier score is zero.\nWhen the model is uninformative and there are two classes, the worst-case values range from 0.25 to about 0.50. Imagine that the model predicts the same noninformative prediction of 50% (basically “¯\\(ツ)/¯”). In that case, every prediction is either \\((0.00 - 0.50)^2\\) or \\((1.00 - 0.50)^2\\). The average of those is 0.25.\nThere are many different ways a model can be bad though, and some of these will produce Brier scores between 0.25 and 0.50."

In this case, the argument name is deg_free but we update it with spline_degree().\ndeg_free represents the general concept of degrees of freedom and could be associated with many different things. For example, if we ever had an argument that was the number of degrees of freedom for a \\(t\\) distribution, we would call that argument deg_free.\nFor splines, we probably want a wider range for the degrees of freedom. We made a specialized function called spline_degree() to be used in these cases.\nHow can you tell when this happens?

If the model doesn’t make any improvements for stop_iter iterations, training stops.\nHere’s an example where, after eleven iterations, performance starts to get worse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is likely due to over-fitting so we stop the model at eleven boosting iterations.\nEarly stopping usually has good results and takes far less time.\nWe could an engine argument called validation here.

    "text": "Per-agent statistics\nThe effect encoding method essentially takes the effect of a variable, like agent, and makes a data column for that effect. In our example, affect of the agent on the ADR is quantified by a model and then added as a data column to be used in the model.\nSuppose agent Max has a single reservation in the data and it had an ADR of €200. If we used a naive estimate for Max’s effect, the model is being told that Max should always produce an effect of €200. That’s a very poor estimate since it is from a single data point.\nContrast this with seasoned agent Davis, who has taken 250 reservations with an average ADR of €100. Davis’s mean is more predictive because it is estimated with better data (i.e., more total reservations). Partial pooling leverages the entire data set and can borrow strength from all of the agents. It is a common tool in Bayesian estimation and non-Bayesian mixed models. If a agent’s data is of good quality, the partial pooling effect estimate is closer to the raw mean. Max’s data is not great and is “shrunk” towards the center of the overall average. Since there is so little known about Max’s reservation history, this is a better effect estimate (until more data is available for him).\nThe Stan documentation has a pretty good vignette on this: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rstanarm/vignettes/pooling.html\nAlso, Bayes Rules! has a nice section on this: https://www.bayesrulesbook.com/chapter-15.html\nSince this example has a numeric outcome, partial pooling is very similar to the James–Stein estimator: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James–Stein_estimator"

The tidymodels framework is a collection of packages for modeling and machine learning using tidyverse principles. This website hosts the materials for both the Introduction to tidymodels and Advanced tidymodels courses.\nIntroduction to tidymodels will teach you core tidymodels packages and their uses: data splitting/resampling with rsample, model fitting with parsnip, measuring model performance with yardstick, and model optimization using the tune package. Time permitting, you’ll be introduced to basic pre-processing with recipes. You’ll learn tidymodels syntax as well as the process of predictive modeling for tabular data.\nAdvanced tidymodels will teach you about model optimization using the tune and finetune packages, including racing and iterative methods. You’ll be able to do more sophisticated feature engineering with recipes. Time permitting, model ensembles via stacking will be introduced. This course is focused on the analysis of tabular data and does not include deep learning methods."
